## What is Snippet?
Our software engineering project is a web app where users can get aggregate information about weather, itinerary planning, and various alerts for designated locations of their choosing. Users can get specified current, hourly, daily, and astronomical weather conditions and alerts based on their current or specified location. Additionally, various itinerary-related planning prompts and notification alerts are provided with the location currently being viewed. This project lives in the user's web browser and uses multiple APIs and public databases to collect and display the information mentioned above.
